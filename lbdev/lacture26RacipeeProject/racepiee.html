            <h3>Daal Chawal</h3>
            <p>
              <strong> Ingredients for Dal:</strong>1 cup Arhar Dal,2 tblsp Ghee
              (Clarified butter),1/2 tsp Jeera (Cumin seeds),1/4 tsp Hing
              (Asfeotida),1/2 tsp Haldi (Turmeric),1/2 tsp Red chilli powder,4
              pods Garlic finely chopped,1/2 inch finely chopped Ginger,1 medium
              Tomato finely chopped,2 green chillies slit,1/2 tsp kasoori methi
              (Dried Fenureek Leaves),Salt to taste
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Process</strong> Wash and soak the arhar dal for 30
              mins.Then boil the dal with 3 cups of water, salt and haldi. If
              using pressure cooker then 3 whistles. Let the pressure release on
              its own. Adjust the consistency right now. If too thick add some
              water and boil for another 5 minutes or if too thin then boil
              further till desired consistency is reached.Cover and keep
              aside.To make the tadka, in a kadai, add hing, jeera, chopped
              ginger and garlic. Sauté till the rawness disappears.Add chopped
              onion.Once the water starts to boil add 1 tsp Salt and 1 tsp Oil.
              It is important that the water is boiling before you add the
              rice.take around 5 mins. Tip in the boiled dal to this , add
              crushed kasoori methi. Cover the vessel and bring to boil. Keep
              the lid closed so that the aroma of the tadka sweeps through the
              dal. Alternatively pour the tadka on the dal in the pressure
              cooker itself and close the lid till further use. To make boiled
              rice: Wash the rice in water 2 – 3 times running your fingers
              through it. This will remove excess starch from the rice. This
              will turn the water milk. Keep throwing the water. Removing extra
              starch from the rice ensures that the rice don not get sticky and
              will turn out fluffy. After the final rinse soak the rice for 30
              mins. In a large pan having a capacity of 2 – 3 litre, boil the
              water. Once the water starts oil for 8 – 10 mins. Check if the
              rice is got soft and then drain the extra water in a strainer
              leaving the rice behind. You Can Try These Too:
